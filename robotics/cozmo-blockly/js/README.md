# ATL Suite to ATL IDE migration 

This folder contains code that must be transferred to the atlide-blockly folder as 
it is used for the work area and is not robot specific.  

# DODO code.js:
- port 9090 is hardcoded - need to be linked to the ros2 package parameter. 
  - for now it is manually changed to 8080
